> Thesis:   Our government should move to a simpler and more methodical process to internalize economic externalities, at least on the federal level, favoring subsidies when possible.  It’s far easier to reward good behavior than cast loophole-filled nets to catch the bad actors.

One of the few responsibilities of government in the economy should be the internalization of externalities.  

For the purposes of this essay, an externality is an uncompensated cost or benefit not reflected in the value or price of a good at the time of sale, where an example might be a gasoline car.  Neither the car manufacturer nor the buyer bears the  cost of reducing air quality, so the car is sold "cheaper" than its true cost.  Internalization is the process of re-exposing this hidden cost or benefit to the market to balance the volume of the original transaction.

Theoretically, if we could effectively internalize all externalities, our markets would be far more efficient as capital would be funneled to higher-benefit areas.  As with many theoretical ideals, there are two enormous problems once this is put in practice.

### Problem 1
First and foremost is that there are really only 4 viable tools [^1] government has to internalize most externalities, and they all carry **significant** cost.   To start, all of these tools increase legal complexity and increase the potential for corruption, increased lobbyist influence, and bias toward vocal constituents.  Additionally, they tend to increase the barriers to entry for new businesses (sometimes might be necessary).

1. Tax - take the cost of the externality and slap it across either the buyer, seller, or both.  This increases bureaucracy needed to collect and enforce the tax.
2. Subsidy - Make beneficial products more price-competitive by crediting the buyer or seller with the positive externality.  This requires far less bureaucracy (you don’t need to enforce anything because companies will work to get benefits).
3. Regulation - Attempt to reduce the size of the externality directly, or set a quota or ban.  I generally dislike regulation when it isn’t the only available method - it has the highest operational and overhead cost, needs incredibly and it’s difficult to predict the economic impact.
4. Increase transparency - use public information campaigns to attempt to increase the perceived cost of the externality to push it back into the transaction.  It’s often ineffective and extremely expensive (campaigns against vaporized nicotine)

### Problem 2
The second problem is that the price of an externality is often impossible to accurately determine.  At the end of the day, everything needs to be converted to a dollars and cents figure in order to practically apply any of our tools.  

Pricing something anything also quickly grows out of hand.  The negative externality of buying a car is not just the pollution it belches, but also the noise, danger, and traffic it generates.  You could just as easily break down danger into danger to the driver, other people, and property.  It’s easy to see how this becomes impossible to capture legally.

While there is no simple solution here, it seems apparent, especially with the costs that our tools bring, that we should try to capture the bulk of the externality in as little legislation as possible, even if we lose some of the resolution of the law.  While doing this, we should define a scientific cost floor for the externality.  In the US, although we can’t put an exact dollar figure on the cost of a cigarette, we tax cigarettes at a cost far below the damage they cause (it should be higher).

> Why should we be internalizing costs that hurt mostly the user - shouldn’t we have freedom in that regard?  Ie: seatbelts, cigarettes.

I disagree with this argument, because it assumes that the externality is very transparent, which it very often is not.  Transparency is not present when the user is ignorant to the externality (asbestos inhalation), the externality is rare (car crashes), or the externality occurs many years after use (smoking).  Daredevil stunts, for example, are generally completely transparent in their risks, and I think they should be completely unregulated.

### Practical steps
If the following is true:
 * The externality is quantifiable to a cost floor (negative for benefits)
 * The tool (tax, subsidy, regulation) is quantifiable to a cost ceiling
 * The cost of the tool is **much** lower than the absolute value of the floor of the externality

We should regulate the externality at the cost floor, preferably by tax for positive cost and subsidy for negative cost, favoring subsidies in general.  Otherwise we should default to doing nothing.

To end, a short list of places where I think we are getting it wrong:
* There’s far too few subsidies in clean energy startups, at least in the ones developing technologies to push efficiency or reduce cost.  The clean energy change is going to happen as a result of cost reduction, not from a moral impetus cast upon the general population
* The impact of regulation is not being assessed properly on small businesses.  Generally regulations have at least some semblance of  goodwill behind them.  However, the impact of those regulations (which often just take up more time) often hurts smaller businesses with razor-thin margins.
* More regulations should be pushed to state and local governments, where they can be customized.  As a short example, there should be no federal home noise regulation - what is right for crowded San Francisco is certainly not right for a rural county in Kansas.

[^1]: There are far more, but I believe them to be either too idealistic or just strictly worse
