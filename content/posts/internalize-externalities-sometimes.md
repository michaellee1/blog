One of the very few responsibilities of government should be the internalization of qualifying externalities.

An externality is an uncompensated cost or benefit not reflected in the value or price of a good at the time of sale, where a classic example is a gasoline car.  Neither the car manufacturer nor the buyer realizes the very real cost of reducing air quality, so the car is ‘cheaper’ than its true cost.

If only we could internalize all externalities, our markets would be far more efficient, and capital would be be funneled from harmful to beneficial products.   

### Roadblocks
As with many theoretical ideals, there are two enormous problems once this is put in practice.  First and foremost is that the price of an externality is often impossible to accurately determine.



The second practical problem is that there are really only 3 viable tools we have to internalize most externalities, and they all carry significant cost.

1. Tax - take the cost of the externality and slap it across either the buyer, seller, or both.  This is my favored method, but increases tax code complexity (it’s already far too long) and increases bureaucracy needed to collect and enforce the tax.
2. Subsidy - Make beneficial products more price-competitive by crediting the buyer or seller with the positive externality.  This opens up avenues for corruption (undeserved subsidies).
3. Regulation - Attempt to reduce the size of the externality directly (ie smoke stack filters) or 

What do I mean by qualifying?

* The externality should be scientifically quantifiable at least to a cost floor.  In the US, although we can’t put an exact dollar figure on the cost of a cigarette, we tax cigarettes at a cost far below the damage they cause.
