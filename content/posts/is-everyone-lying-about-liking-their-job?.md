> People don’t seem to enjoy their jobs as much as they say they do.  You might have noticed the same thing - if you ask someone about their job, it’s almost always a "it’s great!" or "I love it!"  But while it’s hard to put a finger on, and I might just be wrong, it seems to be insincere.

If I’m not wrong, then why are people saying what they don’t mean?

Clearly, a job is truly in a category of its own when it comes to persona and life definition.  Just knowing what someone does gives a small idea into what they’ve done to that point, what they are currently doing, and what they will do: past, present, and future.  That’s probably why it’s often the first question when trying to get to know a person: "What do you do?" or "What’s your job like?" It’s also one of the few things that are so common that the question is one of the few "personal" questions that is rarely a faux pas (it’s even one of the few statistics that we collect by the people who **don’t** have it, the unemployment rate).  While something like this is difficult to quantify, the identification associated with a job is at least powerful enough that people will readily define themselves and others by their occupation.  "I’m an ice skater" is certainly something more  than someone who says "I like to ice skate."

Asking whether someone likes their career then, is probably a significant subset of asking whether someone is enjoying their life, given that the career plays an important role in identification.  Given the human tendency to signal slightly (or much more than slightly) more enjoyment than they truly feel, it’s natural that it might bleed over into career signaling.

It’s a two-part game here, not only is the social signaling important to others, but also to the signaler.  Rather than go down a painful path of slight identity destabilization, it’s far easier to grandstand on a small lie to convince the brain that its career is actually great.  This, as everyone knows, is the origin of the midlife crisis - this small aggrandization of an important part of identity becomes unbearable when summing over time.

What percent of a job needs to be good to turn the dial to ‘great’?  What parts of a job are the most important to feeling on-job satisfaction?  How compartmentalized are each of these feelings?  The social science on this is lacking.

Until the science on this is done, we might look for exemplars.  At least stereotypically, it would seem that the people who are most perceived to love their jobs are those in jobs that have at least one or more substantial negatives.  Maybe we feel subconsciously that there is some kind of utility addition going on?  Lots of love for a job that has low pay, says this mental math, must mean that there is an incredible amount of satisfaction from another aspect of the job.  Or perhaps it’s enough simply to be enough standard deviations away from the mean - the person who lights up in a job where others do not.

Maybe the simple reason I feel insincerity in responses is due to my own doing.  Getting "do you like your job?" could be a question too dull to inspire much enthusiasm.  The feeling of insincerity, at least from my point of view, comes from the juxtaposition of the person’s words and actions.  Maybe there is a different action potential to verbal positive agreement and bodily positive agreement. There are massive deviations from the norm here, and it’s not a given whether the people with extraordinary responses to the question, with their bright-lit eyes are truly sincere either.  An unconvincing argument could be that these could just be the biggest charlatans of all.

I don’t really know if I want to know the magnitude of the lie, if there is one.  There is simply nothing more inspiring than finding one of the outliers and believing that their satisfaction is genuine.
