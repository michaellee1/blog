> I’ve observed that people don’t seem to enjoy their jobs as much as they say they do.  You might have noticed the same thing - if you ask someone about their job, it’s almost always a "it’s great!" or "I love it!"  But it doesn’t seem to be true.  You can see this by simple juxtaposition to the people who actually love their jobs - the classic spark behind someone’s eyes when you can’t get them to shut up about what they are working on.

What separates the secretly unhappy worker from the truly passionate?

### Career as a fixture of identity
A job is truly in a category of its own when it comes to persona and life definition.  Just knowing what someone does gives a small idea into what they’ve done to that point, what they are currently doing, and what they will do: past, present, and future.  That’s probably why it’s often the first question when trying to get to know a person: "What do you do?" or "What’s your job like?" It’s also something that most people have - it’s one of the few statistics that we collect by the people who **don’t** have it (the unemployment rate) rather than those that do.  The identification associated with a job is so powerful that people will define themselves and others by their occupation.  "I’m an ice skater" is certainly something more  than someone who says "I like to ice skate."

Asking whether someone likes their career then, is a significant subset of asking whether someone is enjoying their life.  People in general like to be perceived by others to be enjoying their life - think Instagram photos.  This meaning would give them incentive to exaggerate how much they like their job.

But it could go deeper than that.  Not only does your job send a strong signal to others, it also sends a strong signal to yourself.  As a significant part of your identity, admitting that you don’t like your job is identity-destabilizing.  Rather than go down that path, it’s far easier to tell a little lie to convince yourself that your job is actually great.  This is the origin of the midlife crisis - this small lie becomes too large to bear when factored in over a large time span

### Enjoyment might not be value
Another idea is that enjoyment for a job is not well correlated to the self-perceived value of that job.  

One way this could be true is if the enjoyment derived from the money or status a job provides is mentally compartmentalized away from the perception of the job itself.  Someone might hate their job, but loves more the way it lets them stay at home with their kids.  If you compartmentalize the two experiences, the perceived enjoyment of the job might not include all of the work-life benefits.

Another way is if the impact of negatives is higher in the classification of enjoyment rather than value.  Perhaps a single negative thing is enough to counter the most enjoyable parts of a job, but is less strongly-weighted in the value of that job.  

If this is true, asking "do you value your job?" would be more revealing.

### Other ideas
* There might not really be that many jobs out there that are actually enjoyable.  Jobs are only connected indirectly to value created by those jobs - it has to bounce back from the worker to the consumer to the company and back to the employee.  Jobs are certainly not architected for maximum enjoyment.
* People are incredibly good at comparing themselves to others, and feeling inadequacy by that comparison.  Many people may not feel satisfied unless they are near the very top, which is by definition not very populous.
* Not liking your job is more than just an identity damaging idea.  Societally we’ve been taught that it’s good to be a hard worker, to work through adversity, and to be grateful.  By not liking your job, you are going against some of these ideals.
