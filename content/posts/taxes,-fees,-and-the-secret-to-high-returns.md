**Part of the science-based stock investments series**, my plain-English effort to distill research-backed advice for people to invest in the stock market.

## Exactly what do you pay?

> Note: Capital gains tax is often a prime target for politicians, and may be changed drastically in years to come, depending on who is elected to government.

When you sell a security at a price higher than you bought, you have made a **capital gain**. Capital gains tax is paid on sales of securities or property in the US, on the gain you make after subtracting contributions and losses.

Here’s an easy example:

Say you’ve been investing for a while and have equities worth 400k in your normal investment account on contributions of 50k. You sell the equities to pay off a mortgage, and you must pay capital gains tax on your gains of 350k (400k minus 50k), federal plus state.

In this case, if you live in California (one of the highest state capital gains tax rates), you **end up paying 22.9% of your earnings, or over $80,000**. Ouch. You probably already paid income tax on the 50k in the first place and now you get hit again.

The following table shows the federal capital gains rate for different sales on **long-term** investments (sold after >1 year):

If you sell within a year, which is called **short-term**, you get taxed at federal income tax levels, which are generally way higher. Yet another reason not to buy and sell often!

You’ll have to check your state to see what the state capital gains rate is.

There are many account structures that allow you to avoid capital gains tax — I will cover these in a future article

### Capital Loss Deduction

If you ever take a **capital loss**, or when you sell at a loss, you can deduct this from your taxable capital gains. If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, you can deduct up to $3000/year of it from your income tax (always do this if you can). Capital losses carryover **forever**, so you don’t have to scramble to make use of them that year ([IRS](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/capital-gains-and-losses-10-helpful-facts-to-know-0) source).
> Something that people sometimes get confused about: you need to actually sell the security or property to take a capital gain or loss — this is called **realizing** the gain or loss. If it went up and you didn’t sell it, you don’t owe anything yet.

### Tax Loss Harvesting

For individual index investors, tax loss harvesting is something you only really need to keep in mind if your portfolio drops immediately after you invest. Here’s a scenario to show how it works.

After a bad year, you sell shares of a US large cap blend index. Then, you can turn around and buy a different US large cap blend index from another company.

You haven’t changed your asset allocation much, but the key is that **you have taken a capital loss**, which you can use to write off gains for subsequent years.

However, as I briefly mentioned previously, the IRS’s [wash-sale](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp) rule applies. You can’t buy and sell a ‘substantially identical’ security within a 30-day window, or you don’t get the capital loss credit.
> So where is the line drawn? By precedent, the IRS usually seems not to label things ‘substantially identical’ if it’s a similar index from a different company ([Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2012/06/05/wash-sale-trap-what-is-substantially-identical/#2fb4086572d7)). So a pretty similar Schwab large cap blend index might be safe when transitioning from a Vanguard large cap blend index. Tread lightly here.

### Fees

Part 1 of this series talked about how small fees add up in a big way.

Luckily, if you only invest in index funds on a good broker like Vanguard, the only fee you will pay is a small fee called the **expense ratio (ER). **This fee is expressed as a percent, is generally much lower than 1%, and is taken off your account balance every year.

If you have a broker manage your money, you will additionally pay an **advisory fee**, sometimes called a **management fee**. Many mutual funds just add this into the expense ratio, to create an all-inclusive price called the **management expense ratio**. You can learn about other specialized fees that some managers charge, like loading, commission, or custodial fees, [here](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/costs-investing/).

In general, try not to pay fees other than an expense ratio and an advisory fee if you can, and to keep these as low as you possibly can, whether you are investing your own money or trusting someone else to do it for you. Morningstar has [a study](http://oreillywa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/morningstar-study-on-investing-expense-ratios-2016.pdf) that shows that you can pretty reliably classify a fund’s success simply by how low their fees are.
