**Part of the science-based stock investments series**, my plain-English effort to distill research-backed advice for people to invest in the stock market.

## Why Even Invest?
Choosing not to invest your money means you are losing it to inflation, at a rate of [1–3% annually](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/consumer-prices-rise-in-2019-at-fastest-pace-in-eight-years-cpi-shows-but-inflation-still-muted-2020-01-14). If your saved money isn’t passively making more than inflation, you are bleeding money every day; it’s very difficult for all but the largest income earners to accumulate a significant amount of wealth by saving it up. A savings account? Yeah, you’re still losing money. [Money CD](https://www.thebalance.com/cd-basics-how-cds-work-315245)? You probably break about even.

Investing in the stock market provides a promising premise: capturing returns significantly above inflation and growing your money while you sleep. Investment is not just for high income earners, but for every single person who has a small amount of money they can save — you can start with as little as $10! **That means you.**

## The Premise of Market Growth
When we invest in the stock market, we invest in the stock values of a blend of small, medium, and large companies in the US and abroad. The Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) is a stock index of 500 large companies in the US, often utilized as a health indicator for the economy. When people talk about ‘the market,’ this is often what they are referencing. Here is the S&P500 from about 1950 to now, inflation adjusted:

If you haven’t seen the power of compounding interest before and you like money, it is absolutely beautiful. Your money grows, and then it **grows on that growth**. If you were 20 in 1970, this is what investing your money in the US stock market (S&P 500) would have done for you by 2019:

Notice the purple line, which represents if you just socked away the money each year. **It’s over 20 times less than if you had invested it.**

The above graph is misleading for estimating your **future** results for several reasons. A fairer metric is the **Compound Annual Growth Rate** (CAGR), which computes the smoothed yearly compound growth rate over a time period.
> Note: I see tons of people, including real analysts, make the mistake of using the **Average Annual Growth Rate (AAGR)**, which is just the average return each year. There are already many flaws in estimates as basic as this one, so at least use the right metrics to get the right estimate. More [here](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/compound-annual-growth-rate-what-you-should-know/).

The below graph uses the 1970–2019 S&P 500 CAGR (10.61%) minus the annualized inflation rate (4.17%) over the same period, compounded annually.

Worse, but still great! In this case, you still end up with over **fifteen times more** **investing $5000/year versus saving it**. But if you waited to invest, it ended up costing you a large portion of those gains. While the estimate is highly simplified, and the amount you can contribute may be significantly higher or lower than these charts, I hope this makes two things clear.

First, you can accumulate a large amount of money with a moderate interest rate over the long run. Second, waiting to invest may be missing a critical window and reducing your returns. **Start now.**

## 6 Basics

Here are 6 basics that you need to know about stock investment. I’ll refer back to these throughout the series

**1. ‘Small’ fees absolutely decimate your returns**. 
A 1% annual fee doesn’t sound like much, but it compounds against you. This is what the CAGR compounding above looks like with annual fees tacked on.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*QNyohvFb5Gzo-oRPZQNGVQ.png)

Yeah. That’s correct. A **1% fee just took 29% off** of your returns, and 2% took off almost half. Reduce fees everywhere you can, as they are misleadingly enormous.

**2. People you see on the media talking about stocks are often garbage at getting it right.**
Don’t let the popularity of these shows lead you to bad decisions. In general, try not to listen to pundits that tell you to trade X stock for Y reason on Z timing. [Here’s](https://www.cxoadvisory.com/gurus/) an article that looked at stock forecasting records of many stock pickers. Most of them do worse than random. Jim Cramer of Mad Money gets it right just 47% of the time. But he’s actually one of the better ones.

Abby Joseph Cohen is an Ivy League economist, advisory director at Goldman Sachs, and formerly the chief strategist for U.S. stocks at Goldman. Stellar resume, but she’s also been right in just 35% of her public predictions. There are famous analysts that do even worse. Be careful.

**3. Please don’t day trade**. 
Don’t even think about day trading. If you don’t know what this is, this means that you buy and sell securities based on fluctuations in the market, sometimes within 24 hours. This is the ‘sexy’ version of trading, with unbelievable potential for upside as well as loss. However, empirical evidence shows that you should avoid it. This [really famous study ](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/JustHowMuchDoIndividualInvestorsLose_RFS_2009.pdf)from Berkeley showed that less than 1% of day traders in the Taiwanese stock exchange were predictably profitable. Another [study from Berkeley](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20and%20Learning%20110217.pdf) on day traders in Singapore that confirms the tiny winning population. So what makes that 1% tick? It’s a combination of survivorship bias, luck, and maybe a handful of truly skilled pickers. Day trading is trying to make rational sense of a market that is largely **irrational**. Your weird friend who claims he’s making a killing day trading? Ask to see all of his account history and his taxes. All of it. I’d bet he’s hiding some big losses from you.

![Loss aversion ([Source](http://fqmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WEBSITE-COVER-1.jpg))](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*an2EjzS4Dcdxkquz9QL2hQ.png)*Loss aversion ([Source](http://fqmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WEBSITE-COVER-1.jpg))*

**4. Losing $1000 hurts a lot more than winning $1000 helps.**
This phenomenon is called [loss aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion) and is a really interesting area of research. Some research even suggest that the psychological loss of losing money is two times the joy of gaining it. Behavioral economics demonstrates that our brains aren’t wired to handle huge fluctuations: loss aversion will signal your brain to sell after crashes, and exuberance will urge you to take unnecessary risks after booms ([Paper 1](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/AreInvestorsReluctant.pdf), [Paper 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4580376/)). A reasonable risk profile is mentally valuable for nearly everyone and is likely affect your returns.

**5. You must invest money that is solvent.**
Money that is **solvent** is money that you could afford to do without for a long period of time. Don’t invest money in stocks that is reserved for housing, tuition, emergencies, or short-term life goals. If you are in debt, you should pay that first unless your APR is near zero or you have 401(k) match. When you invest in the stock market, you expose yourself to the potential for extreme fluctuation. If you are invested only in domestic stocks, you should be prepared for **drawdowns**, or peak to valley decreases, of 50%. Here’s a drawdown chart of the last 25 years of the S&P 500.

![Drawdown chart of the last century of the S&P 500. From Acropolis Investment Management ([Link](https://acrinv.com/drawdowns-help-visualize-losses/))](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*WnQ04QsSZyDtOVwMgBcw5A.png)*Drawdown chart of the last century of the S&P 500. From Acropolis Investment Management ([Link](https://acrinv.com/drawdowns-help-visualize-losses/))*

Notice there are two crashes greater than 40% in only 25 years. However, with intelligent diversification, the idea is that you will never feel the full weight of a crash.

**6. The past may not be a good indication of the future.** This may seem obvious, but is something that is inherently risky about investing in stocks. At any given time, nobody knows whether the market will go up or down, much less for individual companies.
