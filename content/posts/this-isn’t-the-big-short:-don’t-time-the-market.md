**Part of the science-based stock investments series**, my plain-English effort to distill research-backed advice for people to invest in the stock market.

Both of these statements are about timing the market. Timing the market means devising market entrance or exit strategies for portfolios based on your intuition of how the market will move in the future. **It also doesn’t work, so you shouldn’t do it.**

### Why not?

Let’s use the stretch of 1990–2019 with our familiar S&P 500. The two biggest crashes are the dot-com starting 2000 and real estate crash starting 2008.

The green dots are the peaks and the red dots are the lowest points of each crisis. If you **perfectly** sold at each green and bought at each red, you would boost returns by over 4X ([source](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/when-does-market-timing-work/)). That’s undoubtedly incredible. But here’s why you shouldn’t do it:

**The first reason** is because timing market crashes has empirically shown to be a losing strategy. [Study](http://www.northstarfinancial.com/files/6314/6523/9571/2016_DALBAR_Advisor_Edition.pdf) after [study](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/942396/mind-the-gap-2019) shows that most everyone loses money when they try it, even among the best institutional investors.

**The second reason** is that if you are right but only near-perfect, you will not benefit as much as you might expect. 

To get intuition for how hard this would be to pull off, I made a sequence that takes you through it, step by step.

This is just before the dot-com crash of 2000–2002. See that tiny bit of blue after the green dot? Say you pulled your money out where the blue line ends, only 60 days after the peak.

The crash happens, and it looks like this.  Phew! You missed that huge drop. Now, somehow you know only 60 days after the red dot that the stocks are about to go up again. You buy again when the black line ends right after the red dot in the graph below.

After you buy, the following occurs: You did it again! Got in nearly at the perfect time and rode the wave.

Any person would say that this was an incredible performance.  Now let’s imagine that you repeated this feat again for the even bigger 2008 real estate crash, buying and selling 60 days after the peak and valley, almost perfectly timing the two biggest crashes of the **30 year period**. 

But being slightly off absolutely ruins the point.  Because you weren’t perfect, you’ll receive **only half** of the benefit that we saw from perfect timing.

**The third reason** is small but significant. No matter whether you are right or wrong, you will almost certainly lose money benefit due to taxes or fees. Here are 3 ways:

1. Higher **bid-ask spreads**, a fee you pay when transacting securities through a broker, will take a small percentage off when you buy or sell during market turmoil. Small fees aren’t negligible.

1. If you end up making a **capital gain** when you sell, you will pay taxes on that gain (sheltered in IRAs). If market timing tells you to sell within 1 year (**short term sale**), you will pay income taxes (high).

1. If you sell at a loss and then market timing tells you to buy again within the next 30 days, you won’t be able to without paying more taxes because of the IRS’s [wash-sale rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp).

You are timing an irrational system (the market) using your irrational system (your brain). Notice how I never even spoke about the consequences of being wrong.  This isn’t a winning game to play. Don’t time the market.
