**Part of the science-based stock investments series**, my plain-English effort to distill research-backed advice for people to invest in the stock market.

In this article, I will talk about research showing that **most financial firms underperform**, and how you can do better. I will also present practical aspects of an economic theory of portfolio diversification that **won its author a Nobel Prize**, and is the grounding for most index-based portfolios today.

## The Mediocrity of Financial Firms

There are a huge number of different kinds of professionally-managed funds, but the most relevant and well-known active classes are hedge funds and active mutual funds.

In general, **hedge funds** are riskier funds that have high minimums and seek to deliver above-market returns. There are several reasons why I don’t think you should invest in hedge funds, but I think that the high minimums alone (think $0.5–1 million) put them out of the scope of this series.

**Active mutual funds** are professionally managed funds that have much lower minimums and are traded publicly. An enormous number of Americans trust these companies to grow their money, but I don’t think you should be one of them. Studies have made it clear that **passive investing has performed better after fees than most actively professionally managed funds** in most years. ([SPIVA report](https://www.spglobal.com/_assets/documents/corporate/us-spiva-report-11-march-2019.pdf), [Study whitepaper](https://d9l6g2vjiqrcr.cloudfront.net/documents/BMT-PS_Whitepaper.pdf), [Source from active fund](https://www.hwcm.com/assets/documents/Marketing-Pieces/White-Papers/2019-Update-Active-vs-Passive-Equity-Investing.pdf)).

Passive investment is exactly what it sounds like. You trade very infrequently and follow the market by investing in several different kinds of stocks and bonds. It’s easy, low-fee, and tax-efficient.

### What about just picking the best funds?

But how about just investing in top-performing mutual funds?

As a great SPIVA [multiyear analysis](https://us.spindices.com/documents/spiva/persistence-scorecard-september-2018.pdf?mod=article_inline) shows, it doesn’t work like that. If you put your money on one of the top quartile US mutual funds in September 2016, there was only a 7% chance that the fund was still in the top quartile by September 2018, and only a 25% chance that they were better than just the median. **The vast majority of winners became big-time losers in just two years**.

Passive long-term investment is a better bet that millions have used to earn great returns over a long period of time.

## Nobel-Prize Diversification

> This section is based on [Modern Portfolio Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp) (MPT), which is a Nobel Prize winning theory that builds mathematical models on expected value and expected variance. See some criticisms [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory#Criticisms).

What is diversification, really? You might understand its general idea, to hold a broad range of different securities in one portfolio to reduce risk. **Securities** are tradable assets, mostly stocks and bonds in this case. But it’s not that simple, and it certainly is not true that you should just buy as many different securities as possible. To be precise with words, diversification is the **selection of securities without perfect correlation to minimize total expected risk while maximizing total expected return**.

### Risk, Correlation, and Expectation

Modern Portfolio Theory **risk** is defined as a portfolio’s volatility, or the amount that it is expected to vary from the mean. This definition doesn’t capture all of the colloquial ideas we associate with the word "risk", but provides mathematical efficiency and is a useful simplification.

![Unsurprisingly, the US dollar and US stocks have a near-inverse (near -1) correlation. ([Source](http://ifund.lv/2018/11/diversification-and-correlation-how-to-create-a-well-balanced-portfolio/))](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KYtyz2c3vAfPxi1V23gy5g.png)*Unsurprisingly, the US dollar and US stocks have a near-inverse (near -1) correlation. ([Source](http://ifund.lv/2018/11/diversification-and-correlation-how-to-create-a-well-balanced-portfolio/))*

[Correlation](http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/correl.htm) is a value between -1 and +1 that describes how two or more variables, in this case different securities, vary with each other. In simplest terms, a near perfect correlation indicates that the securities fluctuate together, while a low correlation means that they do not. Having high correlation between all the securities in a portfolio is undesirable because when one security drops in value, your other holdings will drop as well. This greatly increases risk, because your portfolio is more likely to vary and crash.

The concept of [expectation](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~fewster/325/notes/ch3.pdf) bakes in the concept that MPT works on an unpredictable market. When creating diverse portfolios, you must consider the possibility of different market conditions in the future, many of which may not have occurred in the past. You are hoping to maximize **future** returns and minimize **future** risk, while you are in the present.

### Mutual Correlation

It’s not just important how two securities correlate however. What is most important is how the addition of a new security will affect our total risk and return. I won’t dive into mathematical modeling, but each new security needs to be evaluated against the entire portfolio; not only by its expected return, but its correlation with every other element and its effect on expected risk. Every element must contribute either **fantastic expected returns**, **fantastic expected risk reduction, or a combination of the two**. That’s diversification.

### Asset classes

Including stocks (and bonds) from a variety of different sources, called asset classes, is necessary to achieve true diversification. I’ve summarized the main asset classes in the table below.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2348/1*A624iIGlcPT23kAehVdLyA.png)

As mentioned before, securities must have great risk-adjusted returns to be added. I didn’t include commodities, natural resources, or private equity. These asset classes just don’t have the data or risk-adjusted returns to back their inclusion. ([Source 1](https://www.betterment.com/resources/the-case-against-investing-in-commodities/), [Source 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304405X82900022)).

### Notes on Asset Classes

1. Some historical academic research supports increasing allocations, or **tilting**, towards small-cap and value stocks([Study 1](https://jpm.pm-research.com/content/39/4/91), [Study 2](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/cmsmedia/3775518/the_cross-section_of_expected_stock_returns.pdf)). However, these effects have been absent in the US market for decades.

1. Domestic stocks have undoubtedly performed much better than international in the recent past. If you invest 70–30% or 50–50% domestic to international, you will reduce your return by a significant margin if the past is like the future. However, because we don’t know the future, I hold a significant international allocation. Some people don’t.

### Rebalancing

![([Image Source](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/when-to-rebalance-portfolio/))](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3120/1*hdAk4WFoac1Hh1eLGPryqg.jpeg)*([Image Source](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/when-to-rebalance-portfolio/))*

Rebalancing refers to the process of moving some assets from one asset class to another.

The idea behind rebalancing is that during most periods of growth, different asset classes will grow at different rates. Notably, stocks tend to grow faster than bonds. If you started with a 85–15 ratio of stocks to bonds, this might become 95–5 in several years of growth. This is called **portfolio drift**, and means you’ve now effectively increased your risk and changed your portfolio composition.

Rebalancing protects you against risk and keeps your original portfolio in check. There was an idea in finance long ago that you could reliably capture a ‘rebalancing bonus’ ([Paper](http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/996/rebal.htm)). However, several more recent studies like this [2007 study](http://www.retailinvestor.org/pdf/vanguard.pdf) by Vanguard shows that this usually isn’t the case.

For rebalancing, I follow the advice of [this 2015](https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGPORE.pdf) white-paper, and rebalance when my portfolio changes it’s allocation significantly (>5%).
